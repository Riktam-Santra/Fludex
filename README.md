# Fludex
A very basic manga reader made using flutter and mangadex.


## A few things to remember
- There currently isn't any compiled version of the app, one must compile it for the required platform, see [how to install flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) for info on setting up flutter or [check out flutter's official website for more info](https://flutter.dev/)

- The app only supports windows at the moment. Android and other platforms can be compiled too, just remember that it's never tested on those devices so, it might become a nightmare when you look at it. Good luck to your eyes, honestly.

- The app is in a very early stage of development and hence bugs are expected including some incomplete code that I still can't figure out (for example the page navigation still doesn't work properly) it also doesn't have much functionality except for login, searching manga and reading manga. Some mangas even tend to break the app.

- The app is open source and not to be used for any commercial purposes, it's just a project for both the flutter and the mangadex community to showcase the future revolution flutter can bring in.

- I might not be able to always be there to keep adding features to this one, however everyone's welcome to contribute to the project.

## Compiling the App
- Add the /bin directory of your flutter installation to your system PATH
- Next you will have to (enable desktop support)[https://flutter.dev/desktop]
- Install both the [Dart](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dart-Code.dart-code) and the [Flutter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dart-Code.flutter) plugin installed in your IDE. Visual Studio Code was used for this project.

## Running the App

Open up the **main.dart** file in the /lib directory and press F5. It should say 'building windows application', in that case the app should launch in around 60 seconds.
